[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

[Pre-Chorus]
In silent screams, in wildest dreamsI never dreamed of this

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is badThis love is alive back from the dead, ohThese hands had to let it go free andThis love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tossing, turningStruggled through the night with someone newBaby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burningFlickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

[Pre-Chorus]
In losin' grip, on sinking shipsYou showed up just in time

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is badThis love is alive back from the dead, ohThese hands had to let it go free andThis love came back to me, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free andThis love came back to me, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)

[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leaveYour smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just runBut you come back to what you need

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is badThis love is alive back from the dead, ohThese hands had to let it go free andThis love came back to me, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free and(This love) This love came back to me, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
(This love) This love came back to me, oh
